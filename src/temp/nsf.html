        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) has advanced tremendously and today promises personalized healthcare; enhanced national security; improved transportation; and more effective education, to name just a few benefits. Increased computing power, the availability of large datasets and streaming data, and algorithmic advances in machine learning (ML) have made it possible for AI research and development to create new sectors of the economy and revitalize industries. Continued advancement, enabled by sustained federal investment and channeled toward issues of national importance, holds the potential for further economic impact and quality-of-life improvements.

           National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan
          </a>
          , informed by visioning activities in the scientific community as well as interaction with the public, identifies as its first strategic objective the need to make long-term investments in AI research in areas with the potential for long-term payoffs in AI. AI Institutes represent a cornerstone Federal Government commitment to fostering long-term, fundamental research in AI while also delivering significantly on each of the other eight objectives in that strategy.

         I. INTRODUCTION
        </h3>
        <p>
         AI is advancing rapidly, enabled and significantly fueled by federally-funded research. Increasingly sophisticated and integrated approaches for AI systems appear in applications across all sectors of the economy, and new challenges emerge for advancing, applying, and governing these promising technologies. AI holds the potential to transform lives across our Nation through increased economic prosperity, improved educational opportunities and quality of life, and enhanced security. At the same time, the potential capabilities and complexities of AI, combined with the wealth of interactions with human users and the environment, make it critically important to further advance our understanding of AI, including aspects of transparency, security, and control. Among federal research investments, institute-scale activities enable multidisciplinary, multi-stakeholder teams to focus on larger-scale, longer-time horizon challenges in both foundational and use-inspired AI research, and development of the future AI workforce, as well as addressing some of society's grand challenges. National AI Research Institutes will serve as national nexus points for collaborative efforts spanning institutions of higher education, federal agencies, industry, and nonprofits/foundations in such areas. They should also accelerate the transition of AI innovations into many economic sectors, and nurture and grow the next generation of talent. A long-term, substantive, and highly visible investment in AI research, infrastructure, and workforce development will realize the potential of, and enable the U.S. to maintain global leadership in, AI.

        <p>
         <strong>
          I.A. Definition of AI
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         AI enables computers and other automated systems to perform tasks that have historically required human cognition and human decision-making abilities. Research in AI is therefore concerned with the understanding of the mechanisms underlying thought and intelligent behavior and their implementation in machines. The full AI endeavor is inherently multidisciplinary, encompassing the research necessary to understand and develop systems that perceive, learn, reason, communicate, and act in the world; exhibit flexibility, resourcefulness, creativity, real-time responsiveness, and long-term reflection; use a variety of representation or reasoning approaches; and demonstrate competence in complex environments and social contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
         What is sometimes referred to as “core AI research" addresses, in general, the theory and methods that give rise to these target abilities and their implementation in machines. It includes research in all matters of learning, abstraction, and inference required for intelligent behavior as well as general architectures for intelligence, integrated intelligent agents, and multiagent systems. Machine learning, that is, methods for solving tasks by generalizing from data, has made great advances in recent years through the combination of new algorithms, increases in computing power, and the growing availability of data. Machine learning does not, however, encompass all of core AI; which also includes research on knowledge representation, logical and probabilistic reasoning, planning, search, constraint satisfaction, and optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some lines of AI research, computational models and mechanisms of intelligence draw direct inspiration from living systems. Biologically-inspired computing draws from connectionism, behavior, and emergence in living systems to inform algorithm and system design. Computational neuroscience contributes models based on theory and analysis of computational processes in the nervous system. Behavioral and cognitive science informs much of the motivation and design of systems seeking to implement behavior typical of human perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes and their interactions. Also relevant is human-AI interaction, which studies the interface between people and this class of software artifacts to help bring them into more productive alignment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Perception and communication are critical capabilities associated with intelligent behavior. Where AI is concerned, the field of computer vision studies methods that enable systems to sense and reason about the visual world. Human language technologies (also known as “natural language processing” and “natural language understanding”) research enables intelligent systems to analyze, produce, translate, and respond to human text and speech.
        </p>
        <p>
         Intelligent systems may be able to act upon the world through embodiment. Robotics is closely aligned with but not identical to embodied AI. While an embodied AI may be a robot, not all robots exhibit embodied AI. This solicitation does not include in the scope of this definition teleoperated robots or industrial robots that simply repeat programmed patterns of motion.
        </p>

         As intelligent systems amplify humans’ capabilities to accomplish individual and collective goals, research is needed to assess the benefits, effects, and risks of AI-enabled computing systems; and to understand how human, technical, and contextual aspects of systems interact to shape those effects. Relevant research areas therefore include consideration of explainable and trustworthy AI; validation of AI-enabled systems; AI safety, security, and privacy; and the role of ethics in the design and perception of increasingly sophisticated machine intelligence.

        <p>
         Research in AI also encompasses novel software and hardware architectures, as well as methods for carrying out AI algorithms on a variety of computing systems and platforms, including those that operate under additional constraints such as time (e.g., real-time) or energy, or those targeting specific application classes or use cases. Developing hardware further optimized for AI and ML algorithms or hardware offers the potential for even higher levels of performance.

        </p>
        <p>
         Research in foundational AI seeks to develop theory and methods that are independent of any particular domain of application. Use-inspired AI research refers to research that has use for society in mind. Use-inspired research seeks new methods and understanding in AI by situating the research in a domain of application to simultaneously inform progress in AI and solve particular use cases. As an example, foundational research in machine learning gave rise to breakthroughs in deep neural networks motivated by performance in controlled contexts like character recognition. Later, the further investigation of these methods in the intersection of machine learning and linguistics led to the development of recurrent neural networks in AI while also revolutionizing language modeling for speech and text processing. We use the phrase “use-inspired” rather than “applied” to emphasize that use-inspired research is an expected modality

This solicitation seeks to support work that goes beyond merely applying known techniques and adds new knowledge and understanding in both foundational AI and use-inspired domains. Ideally there is a virtuous cycle resulting from deeply integrated convergent research in which AI advances are motivated by domain challenges, and those domains benefit from new AI advances.

         II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
        <p>
         Building upon the nationwide network of AI Research Institutes, this National AI Research Institutes program solicitation will fund Institutes comprised of scientists, engineers, and educators united by a common focus on advancing the research frontiers in AI. The program seeks to build a broader nationwide network to pursue transformational advances in a range of economic sectors, and science and engineering fields. AI Research Institutes will have as their primary focus the advancement of multidisciplinary, multi-stakeholder research on larger-scale, longer-time-horizon challenges in AI research than are supported in typical research grants. They will accelerate the development of transformational technologies by grounding that research in critical application sectors that can serve as motivation for foundational research advances and provide opportunities for the effective fielding of AI-powered innovation.
        </p>

         <strong>
          II.A. AI Research Institutes Scope
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The vision of the National AI Research Institutes program is broad and ambitious. It is expected that each AI Research Institute will pursue this vision in ways that are uniquely suited to its selected research focus, facilities, collaborations, and other unique circumstances. Proposers are encouraged to convey the unique qualities of the proposed Institute, while addressing the following desiderata common to all AI Research Institutes proposed to this program:
        </p>
        <ul type="disc">
         <li>
          AI Research Institutes
          <strong>
           advance foundational AI research
          </strong>
          that will have broad and lasting impact, contributing new knowledge or methods toward understanding of the mechanisms underlying thought and intelligent behavior and their implementation in machines (see the definition of AI specified above). Institutes aimed at advancing established AI lines of research should demonstrate the potential to radically advance these areas beyond the state of the art. Institutes might also address new foundational AI research priorities that arise from rapid advances in AI and the increasing ubiquity of AI-enabled technology. Institute proposals that do not describe a clear plan to achieve ambitious advances in foundational AI research are not likely to be responsive to this solicitation.
         </li>
         <li>
          AI Research Institutes
          <strong>
           conduct use-inspired research
          </strong>
          that both informs foundational AI advances and drives innovations in related sectors of science and engineering, segments of the economy, or societal needs. Effective use-inspired research achieves synergy among a group of researchers to enable transformative advances in AI, related sectors, and the interfaces between these areas. This dimension of an AI Research Institute will feature clear and compelling goals to advance AI and to accelerate the fielding of AI-powered innovation; it also enhances the transfer of knowledge through the meaningful exchange of scientific and technical information with external stakeholders such as industrial partners, public policy makers, or international organizations, as well as with the broader scientific and educational community. Through use-inspired research, Institutes have the potential to create and share new community infrastructure, including data and software, to further research, promote reproducibility, and support education.
          <br/>
          It is critical that proposals clearly specify how the use-inspired context for Institute research reveals the opportunities for
          <em>
           foundational AI
          </em>
          advances and how those
          <em>
           foundational AI
          </em>
          advances in turn contribute to the related sectors that define the use-inspired context.
         </li>
         <li>
          AI Research Institutes
          <strong>
           actively build the next generation of talent
          </strong>
          for a diverse, well-trained workforce. Specifically, AI Research Institutes should leverage the visionary nature of their research foci to drive new and innovative education and development tailored toward, e.g., undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers, as well as through community colleges and skilled technical workforce training and other opportunities as appropriate that advance knowledge and education of AI, including public understanding of AI. This could include innovative pedagogy and instructional materials, advanced learning technologies, project-driven training, cross-disciplinary and collaborative research, industry partnerships, and new career pathways. Institutes should offer broad, deep, and diverse experiences to build the next generation of the AI workforce, with a focus on broadening participation among the full range of groups currently under-represented in science and engineering. AI Research Institutes should maximize their unique position to grow the next generation of talent that will provide new discoveries and leadership.
         </li>
         <li>
          AI Research Institutes are coherent
          <strong>
           multidisciplinary groups of scientists, engineers and educators
          </strong>
          appropriate for a large-scale, long-term research agenda for the advancement of AI and the fielding of AI-powered innovation in application sectors of national importance. The multidisciplinary nature of these Institutes will catalyze foresight and adaptability beyond what is possible in single research projects; further, the individual projects that an Institute carries out should meaningfully integrate into fundamental contributions beyond the sum of the individual projects.
         </li>
         <li>
          Each Institute will be comprised of
          <strong>
           multiple organizations working together to create significant new research capabilities
          </strong>
          . NSF and partner organizations seek to grow the network of National AI Research Institutes in lead organizations distributed throughout the country to grow new centers of AI leadership and leveraging existing centers of excellence as appropriate. Institutes are strongly encouraged to include organizations that can directly contribute to NSF’s commitment to broadening participation by engaging a diverse, globally engaged research community, integrating research with education and building capacity, and expanding efforts to include the participation of the full spectrum of diverse talent in STEM and diverse institutions across all geographical regions. Participants should be meaningfully integrated into a diverse Institute that is more than just the sum of the parts. Each Institute will have a lead PI with demonstrated vision, experience, and capacity to manage a complex, multi-faceted, and innovative enterprise that integrates research, education, broadening participation, and knowledge transfer. Each Institute will also be staffed with a Managing Director or Project Manager (distinct from the lead PI) and a suitable Management Team to oversee the operations of the Institute. An External Advisory Board is required for all AI Research Institutes. (Potential Advisory Board members should not be approached or identified until the Institute is funded.)
         </li>
         <li>
          AI Research Institutes are
          <strong>
           nexus points for collaborative efforts
          </strong>
          . The "nexus point" function in this program is not a mere state of being, but rather an active set of priorities, programs, mechanisms, etc., whereby an AI Research Institute pursues the continuing growth of collaborations with external partners to bring together people, ideas, problems, and technical approaches for maximum impact beyond the members and the boundaries of the Institute itself. As nexus points, Institutes have the potential to continue to connect with new partners with the best teams and approaches from institutions of higher education, federal agencies, industry, nonprofits/foundations, centers/institutes, and national networks. As nexus points, Institutes promote organizational collaborations and linkages within and between campuses, schools, and the world beyond, and further the Institute’s mission to broaden participation in research, education, and knowledge transfer activities through a network of partners and affiliates.

        <p>
         Proposals are being solicited in the following high-priority areas for awards anticipated in FY 2024. Due dates listed for Group 1 apply for submissions to the themes in this group.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <strong>
          Theme 1: AI for Astronomical Sciences
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         With current and future astronomical experiments poised to flood the field with petabytes of high-quality imaging and spectroscopic data over a wide range of wavelengths of light and with a high temporal cadence, AI technology will be essential for mining and analyzing these data. The primary goal of an AI Institute in astronomy is to bring together astronomy and AI experts to tackle important challenges in astronomy, as well as the advances in AI that are needed to overcome these challenges. An AI institute will serve as a hub and resource for the broader astronomical community by making tools publicly available and by promoting the education and training of the astronomical community in AI methods.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         Proposals can address any relevant combination of AI use cases. Some examples are provided below. This list is meant to stimulate thought about the many potential application areas and is not prescriptive.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Clean raw astronomical imaging, spectroscopic, or time series data by removing sources of statistical and systematic noise.
         </li>
         <li>
          Derive accurate estimates of physical parameters of objects or extract statistical measurements directly from raw observational data.
         </li>
         <li>
          Classify objects on the fly for rapid follow-up observation.
         </li>
         <li>
          Find rare events using anomaly detection.
         </li>
         <li>
          Estimate physical model constraints directly from raw observational data.
         </li>
         <li>
          Predict the behavior of complex theoretical simulations to reduce their computational cost.
         </li>
         <li>
          Develop fast and accurate emulators that can be used in statistical modeling of data.
         </li>
         <li>
          Create an “AI astronomer” who can assist with exploring multidimensional data sets or who knows the astronomical literature.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         Many of these applications may require foundational advances in AI to succeed. For example, advances may be required in dealing with especially large and complex data sets, in adding knowledge of physical laws into AI models, or in developing interpretable AI methods with well understood error properties. Proposals should clearly justify both the selection of the targeted astronomical use cases and the breakthroughs needed in foundational AI research. Proposals are also encouraged to discuss the potential for those AI advances to benefit AI research more broadly or to impact application fields beyond astronomy.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         Proposals are expected to convey a vision and approach that is appropriate for the scale of these Institutes and that produces transformative outcomes. Proposals should also describe how the Institutes will connect with the broader community to disseminate knowledge. The proposed structure, activities, and management of the Institutes to achieve these goals should be clearly described.

          Theme 2: AI for Discovery in Materials Research
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         AI has the potential to revolutionize materials discovery by integrating first principles from materials science, physics, and chemistry with heterogenous multi-dimensional experimental and synthetic data streams to scale and accelerate development. AI can expand the types and properties of materials considered through augmentation of human intuition and by tailoring discoveries to address societal challenges, such as sustainability and those in emerging industries. A successful Materials AI Institute will transform the materials discovery landscape, enable new AI-based capabilities, and be responsive to societal challenges and industrial needs. Advances in AI have the potential to transform materials research in several ways. Some potential lines of research are provided below. This list is meant to stimulate thought about use-inspired research in the intersection of AI and materials, and is not prescriptive.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Multi-modal data integration and dataset development: Data streams that describe material properties and behaviors based on different types of variables are ubiquitous in materials science and span different length/time scales and represent a vast set of modalities, such as simulation, synthesis experiments, and characterization experiments. Research in AI-enabled frameworks for materials research have the potential to catalyze the generation of insights by integration of heterogeneous multi-modal data streams across different length/time scales. In addition, tools and mechanisms are needed to accelerate the development of new data sets with appropriate diversity, speed, and volume to empower ground-breaking AI methods for targeted materials science problems.
         </li>
         <li>
          Foundational AI advances driven by materials research: Extending and tailoring AI methodologies to materials science and its unique data streams creates an opportunity to develop fundamentally new algorithmic and methodical frameworks in AI for materials discovery. From a bottom up (i.e., data-driven) direction, foundational AI advances in this field should fully capture and incorporate the unique characteristics and interactions evident in materials science. From a top down (i.e., knowledge-guided) perspective, the principles of materials science hold the potential to ground data-intensive operations in the rich mathematical complexity and multi-scale nature of the different physical and chemical relationships inherent to materials. The integration of both data-driven and knowledge-guided AI holds even greater potential to lead to significant advances in materials.
         </li>
         <li>
          First synthesis to synthesis at scale: Materials synthesis at scale is a major challenge in materials discovery. The precision and level of understanding required spans various complex phenomenological challenges. Research in the intersection of materials science and AI has the potential to sustainably synthesize materials at scale while mitigating the complex phenomenological challenges related to materials properties, materials processing for reliable synthesis, efficient characterization for measurement of relevant properties, and statistics-based understanding of various stochastic elements present in large-scale systems. Use-inspired AI research for materials science has the potential to revolutionize materials discovery and lead to new technologies that can address complex societal challenges.
         </li>
         <li>
          Human-augmented materials design: While AI holds great potential to automate discovery, it remains critical that this discovery be guided by and responsive to materials scientists who will collaborate with AI systems. The interfaces that mediate AI-driven materials research should be guided by principles for effective human-AI interaction and collaboration. Principled mechanisms of interaction between human experts and AI-augmented technology can change how materials designers think about design challenges and catalyze human creativity in new and unexpected ways—for example, shortening the requirements-design-synthesis-experiment cycle. Effective guidance from domain experts will also help ensure that the design of novel materials is conducted ethically and safely.
         </li>
         <li>
          Interpretable materials AI: As AI accelerates new advances and insights in materials science, human understanding of materials will be advanced even further to the extent that the operations of the system are interpretable by materials scientists. A system with transparent and explicable operations will have a higher potential to contribute to the discovery of new fundamental principles in materials science. For example, might successful AI materials models predict the essential ingredients of microscopic Hamiltonians for quantum materials? Can they provide clues to develop new concepts that expand theory and computation to enable humans to reach the same or better solutions? The more interpretable the materials AI system, the greater the opportunity for materials scientists to explore new frontiers of research in this area.

         <strong>
          Theme 3: Strengthening AI
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         In recent years, AI systems built with multilayer architectures with many parameters trained on massive datasets have become increasingly capable of producing useful and impressive outputs. These developments have found their way into large scale deployment, while their developers continue to strive for higher levels of generality, performance, and trustworthiness. Deep neural networks are increasingly effective in all manner of applications from game playing to consumer recommendations to autonomous driving. Generative models have advanced significantly in their ability to produce constructions in natural language, images and video, leading to applications that automatically edit content or even produce novel images and texts. Unfortunately, these systems are not always reliable and may not exhibit justification for their behavior that is understandable to the people who interact with them. In spite of their limitations, these capabilities are becoming ubiquitous in fielded systems of all kinds. This trend presents the opportunity and necessity to research ways in which AI technologies of all sorts can be improved and integrated toward systems that are reliable and aligned with human intentions and ethical considerations.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         A lens through which one might view the developments of AI systems is in terms of a continuum from narrow to general (or with similar meaning/intent, weak to strong). “Narrow AI” excels at performing specific tasks for which it has been programmed (or trained). Over the past few decades, these systems have far exceeded expectations in an increasing number of feats previously thought to be dominated by human intelligence. Still, these systems can be brittle in the face of surprising situations, susceptible to manipulation or anti-machine strategies, and produce outputs that do not align with human expectations of truth or human values. In contrast, “strong AI” is the aspirational goal of creating intelligent systems that learn and think as adeptly as humans do. Strong AI is expected to be capable of performing effectively in a diverse range of problems subject to potentially contradictory priorities, gain new conceptual understanding from limited exposure to new domains, and adapt appropriately to the expectations of human users. While such systems in principle would be more robust to situations that challenge narrow AI, no examples of strong AI have been demonstrated to date. Research in AI can no longer distinguish approaches simplistically as either narrow or strong. But AI systems of the future will need to be
         <em>
          strengthened
         </em>
         if they are to be as robust as we would like and if we are to keep such technology well-aligned with society’s intended uses.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         Theme Goals:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         This theme promotes the development of next generation AI systems that have been
         <em>
          strengthened
         </em>
         to provide greater usefulness, consistency, and robustness by exhibiting both the high performance of narrow AI and the general adaptability of strong AI. Proposals must address the following goals, taking into account the full context of the motivation described above, while remaining relevant to the contemporaneous, rapid progress in the fielding of large, capable AI models. Institutes funded under this theme must lead advances in theory, methods, or integrative approaches that strengthen AI in all three of the goals listed below:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         1)
         <strong>
          Grounding
         </strong>
         . Systems must understand the concepts they reason over and operate with. We refer to this capacity as grounding. Grounding allows AI system to demonstrate connection between its outputs and the abstract concepts that they operate with. It will also enable systems to understand their risks and limitations. Such an improved conceptual understanding should also lead to robust AI that adapt gracefully and quickly to new domains, is robust to surprise, and resists malicious manipulation.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         2)
         <strong>
          Instructiblity
         </strong>
         . Taking advantage of this firmer understanding, strengthened AI must be “instructible”. This means that systems can be proven experimentally to change their behavior appropriately in response to explicit feedback provided by even non-expert users. Related is how such instructible systems might invert the mechanisms behind this principle to implement more effective and trustworthy assistance to humans (e.g., in instruction, tutoring, and training) or in explaining their understanding or recommendations.

         . Strengthened AI systems must be judged by how well their operations align with expectations of objective truths in a domain and correspond to societal expectations and human intentions in their operations. Proposals must include rigorous plans to evaluate this capability.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         Any AI approaches that contribute to these three goals are in scope. This might include but is not limited to neuro-symbolic approaches, hybrid integrated architectures, or multi-representational learning methodologies.
         <strong>
          Proposals that rely mainly on continuing growth of data-driven models and their access to more data are not responsive to the three goals above unless accompanied by a compelling basis of confidence that true breakthroughs in those areas can be projected and evaluated
         </strong>
         . Technical approaches that integrate and process data from multiple sources and in diverse modalities as appropriate to the domain(s) of application are likely to serve the goals of this theme well. Institute concepts whose technical plans do not promise to advance all three of the above goals are unlikely to be competitive in this theme.

         Any use-inspired research context may be the basis for an institute proposal to this theme. Institute research plans that strengthen AI in such a way that the techniques are generally applicable to diverse application domains are likely to serve the goals of this theme well. Proposers are encouraged to consider domains of broad significance to collective wellbeing. Examples of such domains include but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Protecting the environment to ensure human safety and to safeguard natural resources and wildlife.

         <li>
          Health and wellbeing, including various non-clinical aspects of physical and/or mental health.
         </li>
         <li>
          Civic and public good, for example optimization of infrastructure, responsible resource allocation, delivery of public services.
         </li>
         <li>
          Improving human flourishing, for example, reducing hunger or coordinating humanitarian assistance.

         <li>
          AI advances that enable new discoveries in science, mathematics, or engineering.

The reference to “industry partners” in this section refers specifically to Capital One and Intel in their role as funding partner in this solicitation. The donations from these partners have been agreed upon on the basis of a shared belief in the importance of making progress in the research, education, and workforce development goals identified in this program.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to award, the partner company will not participate in or observe the merit review of proposals. After completion of the merit review process, NSF may share with representatives of the industry partner the subset of proposals which are under consideration for funding by NSF in the associated theme(s), along with corresponding unattributed reviews, panel summaries, and Reverse Site Visit reports. NSF will take into consideration the input of all funding partners prior to making final funding decisions but will retain final authority for making all award decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
         NSF will administer awards under the Program in accordance with standard NSF policies and procedures. All awards will be subject to standard NSF terms and conditions. Industry partners will not oversee the activities or use of funds by grantees under this Program but may engage with grantees as outlined below.
        </p>
        <p>
         Specifically, subsequent to Institute awards, the partner company may make available, at a minimum to all Institutes funded within the respective theme(s), direct contributions of resources including but not limited to software (prototypes or products), data sets, other computing infrastructure. No awardee will be required to use any company’s offered contributions.
        </p>
        <p>
         A company may also arrange to fund its own personnel as researchers-in-residence (RinR) to directly participate, part-time or full-time, with funded Institutes within the theme(s) in which they are participating. These arrangements will be optional and upon the mutual consent of the companies and respective Institutes. No awardee will be required to accept a RinR.
        </p>

        <p>
         Awardees with institutes funded by NSF with contributions from industry funding partners shall grant to the sponsoring entities (the Federal Government and the industry partner(s) contributing to the award) a non-exclusive, worldwide, paid-up, non-transferrable, royalty-free license to all intellectual property rights in any inventions or works of authorship resulting from research conducted under the Program. [Note: the Bayh-Dole Act provides similar rights to the U.S. Government for patents on inventions made under federal funding.] The license to the partner company will include its subsidiaries and contractors, at its discretion, to the extent that such use is specifically in connection with the partner company’s products and/or services. Awardees shall grant the license to the partner company unless the partner company opts to decline the license. Such license shall not extend to awardees’ background intellectual property; however, individual awardees and the partner company may negotiate, voluntarily, in good faith, a mutually acceptable resolution to background intellectual property, if desired, though NSF shall neither enforce nor participate in any such negotiations between awardees and the partner company, nor will any funds provided by NSF to the awardee be contingent upon such negotiations. No rights or licenses are granted by the partner company. Awardees may delay the publishing of data and software describing inventions to first permit the filing of patent applications. That said, NSF terms and conditions will require that awardees promptly publish all results, data, and software generated in performance of the research.

         NSF plans to make two awards in Theme 1, one award in theme 2, and two or more awards in Theme 3, subject to the availability of funds. Institute awards will be made for between $16,000,000 and $20,000,000 for four to five years ($4,000,000 per year on average). Proposals outside this range may be returned without review.
        </p>
        <p>
         In Theme 1, NSF and the Simons Foundation expect to co-fund up to two National AI Research Institutes. The Simons Foundation intends to provide up to $20 million and NSF intends to provide up to $20 million to support up to two new awards in FY 2024 - FY 2028, subject to the availability of funds. The average total size and duration of a grant will be $4M per year for 5 years, evenly split between NSF and SF.

         VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
        <p>
         Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as
         <em>
          ad hoc
         </em>
         reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in PAPPG Exhibit III-1.
        </p>
        <p>
         A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at:

         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in
         <em>
          <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf22068">
           Leading the World in Discovery and Innovation, STEM Talent Development and the Delivery of Benefits from Research - NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2022 - 2026
          </a>
         </em>
         . These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.
        </p>
        <p>
         NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.

         A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria
        </h4>
        <p>
         The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          1. Merit Review Principles
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.
         </li>
         <li>
          NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.
         </li>
         <li>
          Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.
        </p>
        <p>
         These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          2. Merit Review Criteria
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The two merit review criteria are listed below.
         <strong>
          Both
         </strong>
         criteria are to be given
         <strong>
          full consideration
         </strong>
         during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (PAPPG Chapter II.D.2.d(i). contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal). Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including PAPPG Chapter II.D.2.d(i), prior to the review of a proposal.
        </p>
        <p>
         When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Intellectual Merit:
          </strong>
          The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Broader Impacts:
          </strong>
          The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          What is the potential for the proposed activity to
          <ol type="a">
           <li>
            Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and
           </li>
           <li>
            Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?
           </li>
          </ol>
         </li>
         <li>
          To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?
         </li>
         <li>
          Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?
         </li>
         <li>
          How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?
         </li>
         <li>
          Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and other underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.
        </p>
        <p>
         Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
         Industry funding partners listed in this solicitation as funding partners will not observe or otherwise participate in reviews, panels, or reverse site visits. Following merit review and prior to the award recommendation to the cognizant Division Director (see
         <em>
          NSF Selection Process
         </em>
         described below), the NSF Program Officer may share with industry partners the results of the review process for proposals under final consideration in the partner's sponsored theme(s). Materials shared may include proposals, unattributed reviews, panel summaries, and RSV materials. Industry partners may provide feedback to NSF as input to NSF's final award recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          NSF Selection Process:
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.
        </p>
        <p>
         After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.
        </p>
        <p>
         After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements or the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.

          Special Award Conditions:
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         AI Research Institute awards are made in the form of cooperative agreements. The cooperative agreements will have an extensive section of Special Conditions relating to the period of performance, statement of work, awardee responsibilities, NSF responsibilities, joint NSF-awardee responsibilities, funding and funding schedule, reporting requirements, key personnel, and other conditions. NSF has responsibility for providing general oversight and monitoring of Institutes to help assure effective performance and administration, as well as facilitating any coordination among the Institutes as necessary to further the objectives of the program. Within the first 90 days of the Award, a retreat of the Institute's key personnel to address strategic planning of the Institute will be required.
        </p>
        <p>
         Support for each year of the cooperative agreement of a funded AI Research Institute will be contingent upon a satisfactory annual review (possibly including a site visit or reverse site visit) by NSF of the Institute’s progress and future plans, with an emphasis on the quality of the research, education, broadening participation, and knowledge transfer activities. All funding is subject to availability.
        </p>
        <p>
         NSF (or other lead funding agency) may conduct site visits and/or reverse site visits as part of annual review of Institute performance. These visits will be led by lead agency staff, with additional participation from partner agencies and industry partners as applicable to each Institute. These visits may include a panel of external evaluators. The frequency or schedule of site visits and/or reverse site visits for an Institute will be further specified in the award-specific terms and conditions of that Institute’s cooperative agreement.

        <p>
         <strong>
          Acknowledgement of Support
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Awardees will be required to include appropriate acknowledgment of NSF and partner support in reports and/or publications on work performed under an award. An example of such an acknowledgement would be: “This material is based upon work supported by the AI Research Institutes program supported by NSF [and {partner} per award letter] under Award Title and No. [Recipient enters project title and awards number(s)].”

          Role of Partner Agencies in Research
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Agency employees may not be included as personnel or collaborators in proposals to Theme 3 and may not receive funding through proposals. Once awarded, at the request of an awardee, or of the funding agency with the awardee's consent, agencies may separately fund their own personnel to participate in research, part-time or full-time, with organizations awarded under the AI Research Institutes program.

         C. Reporting Requirements
        </h4>
        <p>
         For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.
        </p>
        <p>
         Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.
        </p>
        <p>
         PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.

        <h3>
         ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>
         The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."
        </p>
        <p>
         NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.
        </p>
        <p>
         NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.
